```{r}
?cars
str(cars)
plot(cars)
```


#find variables names and their types 
#find summury of values a variable can take on.

```{r}

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
#str(mtcars)
```
#In 2013, the average mpg (miles per gallon) for a car was 23 mpg.The car models in the mtcars data set come from the year 1973-1974.
#Subset the data so that you create a new data frame that contains

frame called efficient
 efficient

```{r}
#How many cars get more than 23 mpg
mtcars[mtcars$mpg >23,]
#greaterthan 30 miles per gallon (mpg) and have more than 100 raw horsepower
mtcars[mtcars$mpg >30& mtcars$hp>100,]
#cars that have a 1/4 mile time (qsec) less than or equal to16.90 seconds
mtcars[c(mtcars$qsec>14,2)]
# save cars that weigh under 2000 pounds (weight is measured in lb/1000)to a variable called lightCars
lightcars <- mtcars[mtcars$lightCars<2000]

nrow(lightcars)

```
```{r}
#create new variables in a data frame with 1974model 
mtcars$year <- 1974

```


```{r}
l<-mtcars$year <- c(1973, 1974)

```
```{r}
#select cars wight over 3.5 as heavy and less than 3 as light 
mtcars$wt
cond <- mtcars$wt < 3
cond
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')
mtcars$weight_class
cond <- mtcars$wt > 3.5
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)
mtcars$weight_class

```
```{r}
rm(cond)

```


#practice

```{r}
mtcars$mpg
speed<- mtcars$mpg<20
mtcars$speedmpg<-ifelse(speed,'slow','fast')
mtcars$speedmpg

```
```{r}
#install.packages('knitr', dependencies = T)
#library(knitr)
```

```{r}
#find cars with 30 OR horsepower less than 60
mtcars[mtcars$mpg>=30 | mtcars$hp <60,]
